# EDA for Epicurious Dataset

This repository contains my analysis of the Epicurious dataset as part of an assessment by Rapidious. The project focuses on identifying the most common ingredients used in high-rated recipes (ratings above 4). By leveraging Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn, I explore ingredient trends and present findings that can help users discover popular recipe elements.
